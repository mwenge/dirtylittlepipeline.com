#   OK, so you go to the next step. And I said something about a pipeline.
#
#   This is a data analysis utility that structures your work as a pipeline
#   of inputs and outputs. Each step in the pipeline can use a different
#   language and can side-load files into the pipeline.
#   The first two steps in this example pipeline look like this:
#   
#       +-------+     +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+

//   - Use Alt-Up and Alt-Down to navigate between your pipelines.
//   - Use Alt-A to add a new step to a pipeline.

// One useful thing: at any time you can run all the steps in the pipeline from the start by
// using Alt-R. Why not try it now? The pipeline will run from the start and end up back here

// Now that you've seen the basics, let's look at a little more advanced usage.
// Use Alt-Up to navigate to the next pipeline containing the next stage of the tutorial.
